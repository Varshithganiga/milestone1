topic:-Smart Habit Tracker with Daily Updates

The Smart Habit Tracker helps users maintain daily habits by providing a platform to log progress
and receive reminders. It encourages consistency through automated updates and analytics.

Features
1. Add habits with a name and daily goal (e.g., "Drink 8 glasses of water").
2. Mark habits as complete for the day.
3. Send daily reminders via WebSocket.
4. Track weekly completion data and visualize progress.

Database Structure:

Habits table: Stores habit details (id, name, daily_goal, etc.).
Progress table: Tracks daily progress and completion status for each habit.
Backend Logic:

Habit creation validates input data.
Habit update logic ensures that progress doesnâ€™t exceed the daily goal.
Weekly reports calculate performance metrics from the progress table.

Filter Dates for the Last 7 Days:
The system calculates the last 7 days' range and selects progress data that falls within it.
Compile Results by Habit:
For each habit, progress data is extracted and added to weeklyData.
